# PATH
This is a roguelike written in Kotlin.  

It's mostly here to force me to write some Kotlin in an actual application.  I find working
on a small project is a better way to learn a language than tutorials.




## Design Goals

Separate game from UI.



## Utilities

I would like to make utilities for some of the roguelike basics
